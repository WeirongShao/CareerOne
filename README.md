In this project, my goal is to design a database that can serve as a relational backend for a new social
networking site called Career System that focuses on graduating students looking for jobs. In particular, the site should
allow students to sign up and post their resumes and other information. Companies can also sign up and post
information about themselves and job announcements. Students can decide to follow certain companies (which
means they will get all job announcements by those companies), can apply for jobs, and can friend other
students and forward tips and job announcements to their friends. Both companies and students can also search
for matching applicants and job descriptions. All the data about students, companies, jobs, connections, and
notifications must be stored in a relational database, and a web frontend will be designed in the second part of
this project to access the database and present the content to users in a nice form.
